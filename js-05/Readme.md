# HW 05 JavaScript
In the first try, i tried to work this HW through with using a main object 
including functions and variables in line 7 i was able to handle it perfectly but i reached some obstacles which i couldn't manage to overcome. The line 5 and 12 functions were right but i didn't know how to use them. For example i couldn't push them into array object.
# In this new HW commit, i fixed all the problems and Functions work perfectly.
