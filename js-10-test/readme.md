## descriptions: 
Implementing the Todo project with modularization method(with using typescript and other packages)

### procedure and challenges: 
First of i initilized my project with npm init .
Then i instaled tailwind in my project with -- npm install -D tailwindcss -- command and then isntaled the configuration file of tailwind with -- npx tailwindcss init -- command.
I also added above commands to package.json script line for easier access

I started off with designing my html doc with using FlowBites form and button components and styled them a little bit.
 Then i took the input and button IDs and console.log their values when pushing buttons in TypeSctript
 then i had to show the input inside the drawer elemnt.
 for this i also used ID's and more js codes.
 i had to create html tags and style them with typescript.
 in the final part i had to modularize the project and edit the code with using
 export and import synatxes.

 The main challenge was how to use the modularized files
