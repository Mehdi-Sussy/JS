# HW number 10 of javaScript

## descriptions: 
organize the code

### procedure and challenges: 
First of i faced a problem launching Tailwindcss which was a bit tricky even i used the configuration command.
Then i broke down the submitButton addeventlistener function and wrote it down in a new ts file named fumctions. 
I went on with form validation using an if() condition, using every() method and turning it into a reusable function.
