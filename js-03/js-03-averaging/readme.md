# In this assignment i was to take 5 enteries from client and Mean Average it and show the output.
I wanted to write this in an otherway but it didn't worked well:
function sum() {

   if (!isNaN(allEntries)) {

  

    return (allEntries/5)

  

   }

   else if (  allEntries/5 >= 12){ 
   return ("something is wrong!!")}

  

}
 # Can i Write the averaging HW with these codes??
