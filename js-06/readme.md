# HW number 6 of javaScript

## descriptions: 
1- Write an array of users(each are object).
2- then write function which can add, remove a user and or edit its properties.
3- each person should have name, age, id and major.

### procedure and challenges: 
First i start off with writing my array with 2 default persons (object) insde.
then i went on and create an addFunction which is able to add (push method) a person with same
properties as other into the array.
its also possible to define a variable object and then inster the variable (person) in the array.

Then i write a function to delete a person from the object with pop() method. 
problem of this method is that you can't delete a specefic person.

Then i asked chatgpt for the last segment of HW which i couldn't solve and it solve it with a if condition.
